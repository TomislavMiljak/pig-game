a small html-css-javascript non-screen responsive project, 
crafted by coding along Udemy Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript Course instructions.

The credits for the crafted code go to Jonas Schmedtmann, and the learning and practising credits go to me.

Feel invited to play, and leave a comment!

Best greetings,
